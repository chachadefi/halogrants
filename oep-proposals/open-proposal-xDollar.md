### Project Description

---
xDollar is an interest-free stablecoin lending platform that any users can borrow non-custodial stablecoin, xUSD against their crypto assets on Polygon with a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%. 

xDollar’s vision is to become the first cross-chain non-custodial stablecoin lending platform on multi-chains with DAO governance and a multi-collateral vault system. 

xDollar’s mission is democratize the store value of crypto assets on all chains and make cross-chain DeFI accessible to 1 billion users by 2030. 



### Value

---

xDollar has been born with cross-chain DNA and is actively expanding to new EVM-compatible chains like IoTeX. With the official support from IoTeX, we believe xDollar will become a significant piece of stablecoin issuance within the IoTeX ecosystem. The biggest benefit provided by xDollar is to allow $IOTX investors and users to keep their crypto assets and still be able to maximize its value through $xUSD. xDollar is expanding the liquidity and use cases of xUSD. In summary, anyone on the IoTeX chain is able to borrow xUSD without having to sell their crypto assets at 0% interest. 
xDollar has been clear since the beginning to seek for more partnerships and collaborations. So far the team has partnered with Dfyn, Kyber Network, Iron.finance, Firebird, Polycrystal, ApeSwap, Polytopia, and many more to come. xDollar has initiated xCHAIN alliance forces on Polygon and is ready to bring existing connections when xDollar crosses the chain to other EVM-compatible chains like IoTeX. 

### Deliverables

---

The xDollar platform is to be deployed on IoTeX network. Users can stake their crypto assets on the platform to borrow xUSD, a non-custodial stablecoin pegged to $1.
